        The last few weeks have been characterized by rising economic and
        political tensions between the European Union and the United States of
        America. High tariffs are on the cards, which could potentially escalate
        into a full-scale trade war. Not only would the American economy suffer
        from this, but we would also feel the effects of such a conflict. To
        counteract the consequences, now is the right time to push American
        brands off the market and buy more European again! And that is exactly
        why I have created this search engine, with which you can find the
        European alternative to almost any American everyday product. Translated
